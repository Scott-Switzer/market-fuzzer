# Autonomous execution status

## Product objective

Build a sealed, procedurally generated market-evaluation platform that measures strategy robustness across declared mechanisms and hidden world families. It does not claim unbiasedness, impossible memorization, universal realism, or live profitability.

## Current milestone

M1 — product contract, threat model, and migration map.

- Current branch: `codex/m1-product-contract`
- Current PR: not yet opened
- Clean-main baseline SHA: `e042536397b4655ba11171b6a0e9da0ff581c7c7`
- Latest substantive Greptile-reviewed SHA: `0fda71eb2c8832b61e30a5a1a3f690be677bd7c1`
- Latest self-reviewed SHA: `e042536397b4655ba11171b6a0e9da0ff581c7c7`

## Completed evidence

- M0A merged as PR #14 at `591780357335fc0e603c8c3fff5340700687dabf`.
- M0B merged as PR #15 at `e042536397b4655ba11171b6a0e9da0ff581c7c7`; review controls and secret-safe ignore rules are now on `main`.
- Decision evidence now degrades independently for unavailable, failed, and partial benchmark responses; browser coverage asserts those paths and the complete response.
- M0A local `make verify`, browser E2E, and Docker smoke passed. GitHub test and Docker checks passed on `f1af98feaccaf48d9cc45524e195562216fef46f`.
- Clean `main` was checked out and its verification and Docker smoke were rerun after the merge.

## Current work and next executable action

- Define the product contract, strategy-adversary model, claim gates, initial venue scope, and migration map in one focused M1 PR.
- Convert the written acceptance criteria into executable tests as the V2 kernel is introduced in M2.

## Unresolved findings and blockers

- Greptile trial credits are exhausted. Its status check passed on PR #14, but it emitted a credit-limit notice instead of a substantive latest-head review. Per operator direction, self-review supplements unavailable Greptile review until service capacity returns.
- The local Docker daemon's native arm64 `python:3.12-slim` image reports an exec-format error; the Docker smoke passes through `linux/amd64` emulation, while GitHub Docker checks pass natively. This is a local environment limitation, not a product claim.

## Roadmap status

| Milestone | Status |
| --- | --- |
| M0A — decision-evidence repair | merged and clean-main verified |
| M0B — execution controls | merged and clean-main verified |
| M1 — product contract and threat model | in progress |
| M2–M10 | pending |

## Claims currently permitted

- Deterministic synthetic demo evidence inside declared worlds.
- Bounded strategy-stress workflows, role-scoped release views, and documented simulator mechanics where covered by tests.
- M0A decision evidence is a deterministic demo fixture, not commercial validation.

## Claims currently prohibited

- Unbiased or impossible-to-memorize evaluation.
- Live profitability, universal market realism, best execution, production readiness, or all-asset-class coverage.
- Order-level calibration, queue-position realism, cancellation behavior, or fill probability inferred solely from OHLCV data.
